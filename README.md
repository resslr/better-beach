<!-- About the Project -->

## About the Project

This project was created as a tool to be able to help prevent damage to the coral reefs by inputting harsh chemicals into the sea. Many people unknowingly harm coral reefs everyday by using sunscreen that contains Oxybenzone, Octinoxate, and/or Octisalate to name a few, these chemicals harm the development of coral reefs and usually lead to bleaching, which eventually leads to the death of that ecosystem.
